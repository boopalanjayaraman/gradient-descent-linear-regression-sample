# Gradient-descent for linear-regression Example

Contains example implementations for gradient descent algorithm for linear regression (both single variable and multi-variate) in python.

Makes use of Numpy and matrix calculations for multivariate implementation. The programs implement only the converging part using gradient descent for understanding. It does not implement prediction part. For any testing, predict part must be implemented and cross validation should be performed.
